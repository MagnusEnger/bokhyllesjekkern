bokhylla.pl - compare a list of ISBNs to the digitized holdings of the Norwegian National Library (NB). 

BACKGROUND

The National Library of Norway (NB) is digitizing its collections. These fall into three categories: 
* Materials that are public domain
* Materials that are not public domain, but that can be made avialable online because NB has made a deal with the authors' organizations about compensation. The deal is available here: http://www.nb.no/pressebilder/Contract_NationalLibraryandKopinor.pdf
* Materials that are noe public domain and not covered by the deal described above - these are noe available to the public. 

The materials that are publicly avialable can be accessed through Bokhylla (The Bookshelf): http://www.nb.no/bokhylla

More information in Norwegian:

The holdings in the different categories are described in certain files, see below. 

PREPARATIONS

1. Get hold of ISBNs. 

If you use Koha as your ILS, you can log on to MySQL from the command line and run this query:

mysql> SELECT DISTINCT isbn FROM biblioitems WHERE isbn != '' INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/isbn.txt';

This will give you a list of all the distinct ISBNs in your catalogue, in a file called /tmp/isbn.txt. This list may contain some extra information, and if a record has more than one ISBN you will get things like "isbn1 | isbn2", so a bit of manual cleaning up may be called for. 

2. Get hold of the files from NB

3 I det fri                 -> public.txt                 -> Books in the public domain
4 Totalt                    -> totalt.txt                 -> 2 + books that are not available outside NB
